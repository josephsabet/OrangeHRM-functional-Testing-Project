# OrangeHRM-functional-Testing-Project
In this project, the students will split into teams, each team consists of 2-3 members. We will implement all the software testing process activities here.

**Team Allocation:**
- Team 1: Will work on My Info Module (Employee View)
- Team 2: Will work on Admin Module

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

Your company got a new project, and your team is responsible for performing all related testing activities.

In this phase:
1. Each QA team needs to read and understand the requirements in the [SRS document](https://axsosacademy.thinkific.com/courses/take/quality-assurance-bootcamp/pdfs/57910382-srs-document-orangehrm)
2. Create a basic board on Trello called "OrangeHRM - Functional Testing" with the following columns:
   - TO DO
   - In Progress (which means in progress writing test cases)
   - Blocked
   - Testing
   - Done

## Phase 2: Test Plan

After fully understanding project scope:
1. Work on your test plan (upload as PDF document)
2. Break down each requirement into individual cards (user stories)
3. Assign and split the cards between team members
4. Prepare to move to phase 3

## Phase 3: Test Cases Design

Each team member should:
- Design test cases for assigned user stories
- Ensure test cases are detailed and clear
- Follow this [test case template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LkL7otjlXpSEvTSKGYiC0fAz2yg5YG05VusIh6YkD2o/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0)

## Phase 4: Test Execution

Execute test cases and:
- Mark them as passed/failed
- Report any bugs found

Deliverables for this phase:
- Bug report as PDF (if any)
- RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)

## Phase 5: Test Summary

Each team must submit:
- Test summary report (can be custom format)
- Report should include:
  - Number of passed tests
  - Number of failed tests
  - Number of skipped tests
